_Build an application with GitHub Copilot agent mode in less than an hour._

## Welcome

People love how GitHub Copilot helps them write code faster and with fewer errors.
But what if GitHub could create a multi-tier application with a presentation, logic, and data layers based on requirements written in natural language?
In this exercise, we will prompt GitHub Copilot agent mode to create a complete application.

- **Who is this for**: Intermediate developers familiar with GitHub Copilot, basic GitHub, and basic web development
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce GitHub Copilot agent mode and how to use it for application development.
- **What you'll build**: You'll use GitHub Copilot agent mode to create a fitness application as the gym teacher of a high school.
- **Prerequisites**: Skills Exercise: <a href="https://github.com/skills/getting-started-with-github-copilot">Getting Started with GitHub Copilot</a>.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Start up a preconfigured development environment for making a multi-tier application.
2. Prompt in GitHub Copilot Chat and select the edit tab and select agent mode from the edit/agent drop-down.
3. Try creating the application with GPT-4o.
4. Try other LLM models to see other output.

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the "Actions" tab of your repository (or visit `https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPO>/actions`).

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
