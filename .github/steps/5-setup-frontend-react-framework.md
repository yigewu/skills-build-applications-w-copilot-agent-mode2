## Step 5: Setup the frontend React framework, update the components, and start OctoFit Tracker app

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Setup the octofit-tracker frontend React framework.
- Update the following components to include the React framework:
  - src/App.js
  - src/index.js
  - src/components/Activities.js
  - src/components/Leaderboard.js
  - src/components/Teams.js
  - src/components/Users.js
  - src/components/Workouts.js
- Start the React app and check the output.

Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
> - Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> - Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> - Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

>   make sure all components are pulling data from the REST api endpoint

> - Make sure to use the correct port and protocol http or https.
> - Update src/App.js to include the main navigation for all components.
> - Make sure react-router-dom is used for the navigation menu.
> - The react app should show the navigation menu and the components.
> - Update all components to log the fetched data and make them compatible with both paginated (.results) and plain array responses.
> - Add console.log statements to each component to log the fetched data and the REST API endpoints.

### :keyboard: Activity: Start the react app and check the output

Now, let's actually try running the react application! In the left sidebar, select the `Run and Debug` tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.

Go to the running React Frontend url that pops up for port 3000 that looks like the following:

Once you open it in your web browser it should look like the following:
